Version 0.2: In development
===========================

**Features:**

* New API v2! Built on django-rest-framework, it should be simpler,
  easier, and less buggy. See documentation for API details.

* Switched to django-configurations. You'll have to update your settings files,
  but understanding where settings are coming from should now be much easier.


**Backwards-incompatible changes:**

* Ditched API v1. It used tastypie and I jettisoned that.

* To use API v2, you'll need to create new API tokens in the admin in
  the Token section.

* Switched from Jinja2 templates to Django templates. If you had your
  own theme, you'll have to redo it with Django templates.


**Other changes:**

* Moved a bunch of files from ``richard/`` to the new base app in
  ``richard/base/``. This cleans up the richard project directory a
  bit.

* Updated to django-haystack 2.0.

* Cleaned up the search page a bit. Added a category facet.

* Cleaned up video listing pages.

* Category pages now show draft videos if you're an admin.

* Updated to Django 1.6.

* Updated requirements.
